        <p class="p-info">Like several parts of the world, especially Europe, India has been experiencing a massive surge of COVID-19 cases and deaths. As of April 10, 2021, India is the 3rd leading country based on the USA and Brazil's identified cases. Since the middle of March 2021, the second wave has started, and on April 09, the highest number of cases (144,829) has been identified in India. The major affected states are Maharashtra, Kerala, Karnataka, Andhra Pradesh, Tamil Nadu, Andhra Pradesh, Delhi, Uttar Pradesh, and West Bengal. Despite this high caseload, several national movements such as the farmers' movement, election in several states have been going on. Those can increase the risk of transmission of COVID-19.</p>

        <h2>Sharp rise in cases</h2>
        <p class="text">The rise in case numbers has been exponential in the second wave.
            On 18 June last year, India recorded 11,000 cases and in the next 60 days, it added 35,000 new cases on average every day.
            On 10 February, at the start of the second wave, India confirmed 11,000 cases - and in the next 50 days, the daily average was around 22,000 cases. But in the following 10 days, cases rose sharply with the daily average reaching 89,800.

        <h2>Unreported deaths</h2>
        <p class="text">The number of daily deaths has risen sharply in the second wave. India reported 1,761 deaths on Monday, taking the toll to over 180,000 since the pandemic began. Crematoriums have been running day and night in several cities, and people have to wait for hours to get the deceased cremated or buried. Experts say this shows that the actual number of deaths could be much higher. </p>
